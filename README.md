WebExtension for full-text search through your's browsing history.

Have you ever had hard time to find _that nice article i read a year ago_?
Well, me too. This is where **Memberry** comes to the rescue.
Browse some pages (obviously), then type `mem` in browser's address bar, hit <kbd>space</kbd> and type your search query.
It's that simple.


## Installation

Extension relies on native application to store and index web pages.

Download install file from [latest release][1] and walk through installer pages.
It is recommended to install in user profile folder (default location) to avoid problems with permissions.


## FAQ

**Q: Do you send any information to remote servers?**

**A:** Nope. All your data stored locally near host executable file.

**Q: Will it index _my super secret_ page?**

**A:** No, if you don't want. There is a blacklist in the settings.


## ToDo

 * [ ] Add domain to blacklist by click on extension icon.
 * [ ] Extended search on external page.
 * [ ] Indicate whether page was indexed or not.
 * [ ] Add default blacklist.
 * [ ] Draw better icon.
